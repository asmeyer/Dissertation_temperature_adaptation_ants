# Sharing my dissertation projects     
My goal is to make my research reproducible and open to anybody who wants to expand or double check my data analyses. I'm trying to model the way I layout each project following this paper: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424

Basically, anybody should be able to download any one of my projects(or whole dissertation repository), understand the files and recover similar/identical results.
