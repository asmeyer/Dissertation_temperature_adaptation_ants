# Sharing my dissertation projects     
My goal is to make my research reproducible and open to anybody who wants to expand or double check my data analyses. I'm trying to model the way I layout each project following this paper: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424

Basically, anybody should be able to download any one of my projects(or whole dissertation repository), understand the files and recover similar/identical results.

#Dissertation Questions
* What is the evolutionary history of critical stress proteins in ants?    
* To what extent are common woodland ants locally adapted to their environment? And how does the stress response follow these patterns of adaptive variation?    
* How do other stressors that accompany climate change influence the thermal physiology of these ants?    

* What is the functional diversity of the proteome that is important for thermal tolerance?
* Do common woodland ants at the northern range limits face thermal constraints?
